   <p> My name is Giovanna Stevens and I am a Web Developer! I began my journey in October 2023. I had previously taken some courses in Computer Science, before switching over to complete my Business and Organizational Leaderhship Bachelor's of Science. <br />
    The interest in web design and development stuck with me all throughout and when I found myswelf with the time to fully engage and complete a Web Development course, I jumped at the opportunity! 
    <br /> 
    My interest in Web Development as of right now lies in assisting business, small and large, to creating great websites that not only function well but also draw and keep the viewers.
